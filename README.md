# Wine_Quality_Prediction
Build a machine learning model from a dataset to predict the wine quality is good or bad.

# Objective:
Wine classification is a difficult task since taste is the least understood of the
human senses. A good wine quality prediction can be very useful in the
certification phase, since currently the sensory analysis is performed by human
tasters, being clearly a subjective approach. An automatic predictive system can
be integrated into a decision support system, helping the speed and quality of
the performance. That is why our aim is to develop a predictive model on this
data is expected to provide the wine quality is good or bad.

# Introduction:
In this project, I used Kaggle‟s Red Wine Quality dataset (The dataset contain
number of columns is 12 and the number of rows is1600) to build various
classification models to predict whether a wine is “good quality” or not. Each
wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 2 and 8. For the purpose
of this project, I converted the output to a binary output where each wine is
either “good quality” (a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7). The
quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables:

* Fixed acidity
* Volatile acidity
* Citric acid
* Residual sugar
* Chlorides
* Free sulfur dioxide
* Total sulfur dioxide
* Density
* pH
* Sulfates
* Alcohol

# Methodology:
Here we our project to divided in to 6 parts:
* Discuss about Install a bunch of packages
* Exploring Variables and show statistical report
* Convert to classification report.
* Algorithm comparison
* Make Prediction
* User Input/output

# Prerequisites Tools
* Python
* Pandas
* matplotlib
* numpy
* scikit-learn

Note: Here you can test your own data.
